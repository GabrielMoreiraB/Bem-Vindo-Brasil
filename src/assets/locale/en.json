Then head towards the city center, where Liberty Square houses cultural spaces such as the Bank of Brazil Cultural Center, the Minas Gerais Memorial, the Mines and Metal Museum, the UFMG Knowledge Space, and the FIAT Cultural Center. Nearby, it's also worth checking out the Popular Art Center, the Mineiro Museum, and the Abílio Barreto Historical Museum to complete the tour. With more time in the city, go to Mangabeiras Lookout or Pope's Square for a beautiful sunset. And of course, don't miss the Central Market to taste some delicious Minas Gerais treats!"
